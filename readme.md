AI Financial Market Scanner
This application is a powerful, automated tool that scans broad financial news from around the world using the NewsAPI. It then leverages Google's Gemini AI to analyze the collected articles, identify potential short-term and long-term investment opportunities, and sends a formatted report to a list of email recipients.

The script is designed to be run on a schedule (e.g., via Windows Task Scheduler), providing you with timely market insights without manual effort.

Features
Broad Market Analysis: Scans general financial news to discover new opportunities, not just monitor a predefined list.

AI-Powered Insights: Uses a sophisticated prompt with Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model to identify promising companies based on news sentiment.

Short & Long-Term Focus: The AI report is structured to distinguish between potential short-term catalysts and long-term strategic advantages.

Automated Email Reports: Delivers a clean, professionally formatted HTML report directly to your inbox.

Article Deduplication: Intelligently keeps track of articles it has already processed to ensure you only get analysis on new information.
